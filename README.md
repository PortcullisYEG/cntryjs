Allow Whitelist Countries & Block Blacklist Countries - Display ACCESS DENIED Error - Using Free IP Info API Third Parties, In this video, I'm gonna show you how to create a country restriction widget with two options for visitors to see my website, whitelisted countries or blacklisted countries, I'm using Vanilla JavaScript, you can customize my script and use it on your website or web application, I must say that if JavaScript is disabled in the user's browser, nothing will happen because our processing is done on the client-side or frontend. so if you want to handle a safe country restriction I suggest you use a server-side or backend country restriction like a PHP script or apache htaccess or any other choice.
